<!--Brief introduction about the source project (official project definition is an option): -->

The lightning network is a second layer technology applied to bitcoin that uses micropayment channels to scale its blockchain’s capability to conduct transactions more efficiently. Transactions conducted on lightning networks are faster, less costly, and more readily confirmed than those conducted directly on the bitcoin blockchain

### Why _Lightning network_

Lightning network was invented for speed and lower costs:

- Significant increase in transactions per second Micro payments can be carried out with better efficiency with the lightning network and it will be instantaneous.
- Support for altcoins making it horizontally scalable
- The initial transaction fees in this network are cheaper compared to that of the original bitcoin network Lightning network has the same security as Bitcoin’s main chain while keeping transactions in the layer two till the time they are settled on the main chain.

**Furthermore, the DAppNode package for Lightning Network allows you to access a UI provided by RTL (ride the lightning), where you can easily access your wallet and execute transacitons over Bitcoin network.**

### Warning :warning:

Both LND and RTL are beta software. Don't be completely #reckless.

It is recommended to save backups every time you update the package, or even from time to time with a cron job.
For many reasons we don't save any seed to restore the wallet, and having an up to date backup is crucial to not lose any funds in case something bad happens.
